# Ryohei Tsuda - @lyohe

Hi, I'm Ryohei - a software developer working in Tokyo.

I worked as a financial controller at several companies for around a decade, and quit it to learn programming because I knew that most of future work in accounting around me would be software engineering.

## ðŸ”­ What Iâ€™m interested in:

- develop my own accounting software with APIs to automate all activities related to financial accounting.
